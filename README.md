# factoryFunctionPatternForPets
Created with CodeSandbox

I wrote code to help Sharon's Pet Rescue (fictional) get some animals adopted! I started by creating a factory function pattern that accepts each animal's name, species, and tiredness as a parameter.

I also wrote methods to indicate each animal's status, including whether they are sleeping or awake and ready to play! The status helps visitors know which animals they can interact with and get to know.
